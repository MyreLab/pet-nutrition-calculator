# Pet food calculator

This Python program calculates the daily amount of food for pets and outputs the right combination of wet and dry food based on pet's weight. Created for cats and dogs, based on the nutritional labels of both of my pets. Code can be adapted if user uploads their own nutritional information and adjusts the code to work with their own measures (e.g. cups, scoops, etc).

Methods:
- Linear regression was used to allow for dynamic calculation of cat food requirements based on cat's weight
- User-defined prompts were used so that user can enter specific parameters, such as weight, diet type, etc.
- Nested if statements implemented to handle branching logic for combination diet
- Functions were written to simplify arithmetic calculations
